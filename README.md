Research site for improving the ability of basic diffusion models by utilizing the self-similarity of the fractals
1. U-Net structural change
2. Changing sampling techniques  
(Enhancing Diffusion Models with Self-Similarity)
[ We will measure the dimensional definition and complexity using box counting and utilize various fractal techniques ]
3. The data set will be used by cifar-10, imageNet
