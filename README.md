Research site for improving the ability of basic diffusion models by utilizing the self-similarity of the fractals
1. U-Net structural change
2. Changing sampling techniques
(Improve image generation performance through sampling by identifying complexity with fractals as a dimension)
[We will use box counting to measure dimension definition and complexity and utilize various fractal techniques.]
3. The data set will be used by cifar-10, imageNet
